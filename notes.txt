This is a simple counter application built using React and Redux. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the code does:

The CounterMain component is a functional component that displays a counter on the screen. The counter has three buttons: Increase, Reset, and Decrease.
The useSelector hook is used to access the current value of the counter from the Redux store. This value is displayed on the screen.
The useDispatch hook is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store. These actions are defined in the ../redux/slice file.
The handleIncrease, handleReset, and handleDecrease functions are event handlers for the Increase, Reset, and Decrease buttons respectively. When a button is clicked, the corresponding action is dispatched to the Redux store.
The return statement of the component renders the counter and the buttons on the screen. It uses Bootstrap classes for styling.
